<h2>BEST FRIENDS</h2>

        <h3>I’ve always been “blessed” with great friends. My first memory of a best friend was a girl named “Ellie”. She was in my Kindergarten class and lived in the same suburb as me. We used to play littlest pet shops and Polly pockets together. Even at such a young age I still remember feeling grateful to have a best friend. The time we spent together was very enjoyable. I moved schools in the middle of kindergarten and I have been told many times by my sister and mother that it was because I was ‘dumb’.
            Anyway for approximately the next 5 years my best friend was ‘Charlotte’. She was a great great best friend. Our mother’s were close and my sister also got along well with her. Charlotte had a younger sister who we enjoyed teasing. I remember she had a really cool house on battle axe block, actually at that time I also lived on a battle axe block. Her mother was from New Zealand so every time I hear a kiwi accent I think of her. I remember Charlotte and I’s first fight, I cannot even remember what it was about but all I can remember is it ended with her mother suggesting a ‘sleep over’. That feeling of excitement pushing aside my anger/sadness about our fight is a feeling I’ll never forget. I wouldn’t want to have my first sleepover with anyone else. Charlotte was also that best friend wear you made those dance song videos, we also divulged into acting. We made up little scenarios and filmed them on her iPad and presented them as movies to our parents as a reason why they should let us have a sleep over. (classic millennial style meme) In year 5 Charlotte had to move schools and our friendship slowly dwindled, however I will always treasure her has my younger childhood best friend.

            Year 5 I had a small best friendship with “Allegra”. I remember we could talk for hours and hours about the most randomst of things. Next came ‘Jessica’ she made me laugh like no one else. I remember my year 6 teacher told my mum that I was “being very lovely” by “taking Jessica under her wing” and that we were best friends. I hadn’t even realised that we were until she said that. She was a small asian girl who was loved by all, we had a very unserious friendship but I remember I was having shit time at home and was at school crying, I told Jessica what was happening and her concern about me really comforted me, I knew I loved and that she was special. I also remember laughing so hard in French class that I pissed myself… I think we were learning the Lego movie song in French and we were just dying of laughter. I moved schools in the middle of year 7 and spoke to her every couple of years after that

            I went through many ‘tester’ best friends when I started a new school in the middle of year 7, Chantelle and Evita to name a few. But I a monumental best friend was “Sophia” we spend years together being best friends but it felt like a lifetime. I remember she was she was my first friend that had divorced parents (like I). She was a very reliable best
            Friend and always had my best interests at heart. She’s is still one of those people I just think “she’s getting into heaven”. We had many sleep overs, went to many beach’s, party’s and spend many high school classes sitting next to each other. I wish I could go back to year 9 science classes, I had many a laughs in that room.

            One of my most treasured best friendships was actually a threesome, well I guess there were 4 of us. Myself Imani Sebastian and Izabelle. When I think about them I think of all those times where I laughed so hard to the point my stomach was sore. I ended up in a lot of classes with Imani, I remember when I was first getting to her know her I thought “she’s abit up tight” but, Imani Imani Imani, she is truly the essence of a best friend. Growing up I was had this feeling of ‘worry’, just bit stressed out all the time. I don’t know what it was about her but she just made me feel like everything was going to be alright. I remember she had a zip line in her back yard that her father made, everyone was having a go and Imani insisted I have ago, the video still haunts me, I jumped off the tree branch and within seconds let go of the handle bars, I flung to the bottom of the safety harness and was dragged along the ground. We laughed for years about that picture of me letting go of it and bouncing to the ground. When I was bestish friends with Imani I remember feeling jealous. But not a mean or harmful jealousy, more of a distant loving jealousy. I remember going to sleep many times wishing I was born into Imani’s family, (obviously I wished for that in a ignorant sort of way / everyone has their own struggles vibe) But Imani was a ‘cool girl’ before ‘cool girl’ existed. She had the cool things in her cool room while she listened to her cool music, and I will forever try to embody that coolness. Imani was sensible but just so funny. Mixed with Sebastian and Izabelle they made the later years of high school some of my lifetime favourites. Honourable tributes to my love of highschool were Emily H, Gigi, Elly, Ivy, Emily S and Bianca.
